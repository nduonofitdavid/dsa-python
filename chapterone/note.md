# Bitwise operations

- Bitwise operations are operations that are performed on the bits of a number. When the number is passed in, that number is converted into binary, and then operations are performed on the bits of that number.


## Examples of bitwise operations

- ~ bitwise compliment
- & bitwise and
- | bitwise or
- ^ bitwise x-or
- << shifts bits left, filling in with zeros
- \>> shifts bits right, filling in with sign bit.

## Bitshifting

- The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations, the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right.

- Since registers have a fixed boundary, some bits will be shfted out of one end, while the same number of bits are shifted in from the other end.

- So what this basically does is shift a bit a number of places to the right or to the left.



# Sequence types
- All sequences defines comparison operations based on lexicographic order, performing an element by element comparison until the first difference is found.

- Therefore [5, 6, 9] < [5, 7] because of the entries at index 

- Comparison operators in sets are not done lexicographically, because they are not ordered, but are rather done based on mathematical notation of a subset.

## Lexicographically

- This means in alphabetical order, like words in a dictionary. It describes the way things are ordered based on their position in a dictionary or similar reference, comparing characters or elements from left to right.
